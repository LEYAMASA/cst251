						<p>For this lab, we have to put in a sidebar divider onto the
							right side of our lab page and put in a sticky function for our
							homepage and CSS links within the HTML. This lab was probably the
							first of the most difficult labs we have to do even if we did
							the lab with a partner. I went over this lab with my partner,
							Eva-lyn, as we went over 2 hours trying to get the aside-tagged
							sidebars to work properly as we already understood how the
							sticky function worked.

					<h2> <span> Problems </span> </h2>
						<p> The problems with this lab was that the instructions for
							making the aside-tagged "sidebar" stick towards the right of our
							main content was difficult to figure out since the lecture doesn't
							cover CSS positions and direction settings enough for both
							Eva-lyn and I to understand. We were stumped on how the positions
							worked in the CSS as we had no idea on how the position
							manipulation worked with the amount of pixels determining where
							the sidebar would be placed in the webpage.
            </p>
