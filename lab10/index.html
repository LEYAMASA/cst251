          <h2> <span> Challenges </span> </h2>
						<p>In this lab, the challenges provided in this lab was the
						inclusion of new fonts as well as customizing them within the
					  code itself. During this lab I've worked in a video session with my
					  partner, Eva-lyn, as we challenge ourselves with the inclusion of
						more text font types as well as adjusting text settings. For myself,
					 	I've changed using letter spacing as well as lowercase text
				 		transformation to apply from what we've learned from the lecture.
						I've also included a new <span> Script </span> and <span> Serif
						</span> font to my lab page as a requirement to add more font
						families.</p>

					<h2> <span> Problems </span> </h2>
						<p> The problems set by this lab itself was to check the CSS and
							the HTML to see if the text spacing and transformation was
							applied at the right places just to ensure the settings don't
							override. It was also a problem that Eva-lyn and I had a small
							issue of getting the Google fonts to work to which we were
							confused at the process, but we managed to get the font to work
							by linking the Google font in the HTML.
