					<h2> <span> Challenges </span> </h2>
						<p>The challenges of this lab was using <span> CSS Selectors </span>
              by using different conventions within elements and tags as to
              customize HTML. I had some difficulty figuring out specific
              conventions in order to properly make them function. I had to ask
              my partner, Eva-lyn, to check some of the changes I made to my
              lab page concerning the use of commas in combining divs and
              classes.</p>

					<h2> <span> Problems </span> </h2>
						<p>The problems I had for this lab was getting a good grip on the
            fundamental structuring of the code by using these CSS Selectors.
            Some functions I tried didn't work correctly by using commas article
            at an incorrect placement as to not confuse classes, ids, and
            elements. I still need to get used to on experimenting this process
            whenever I have some time and motivation to know how much more I can
            go with <span> CSS Selectors </span> in more complex customizations.
