						<p>In this lab, the challenges provided was to include dividers with
						special CSS properties that includes centering and floating. We were
					 	tasked in making four dividers based on testing these new functions
					  as one would be tested the floating property with text and three
						other diveders are tested on centering elements such as text and
						images.</p>

					<h2> <span> Problems </span> </h2>
						<p> This lab by itself was a bit difficult to manage since my code
						structuring within the CSS and HTML are unorganized with the past
						labs that keeps accumulating the coding experiences we've learned
						this far. So, I eliminated some of the unnecessary CSS code that
						was irrelevant to this lab's focus and reorganized the HTML to get
						a better view of my code. Then, I started experimenting with
						floating and centering properties in the CSS. The centering
						properties were more difficult than understanding floating as some
						text and image properties wouldn't stick to the middle of the
						dividers. I would like to explore more  with centering as to combine
						text and image elements in the future.

		<h2>Floating</h2>
				<p>A summers day ...we're floating and bloating ..you and i
			we're bloating and a floating and waving as we cry ...
			we're crying as we're floating and a cloud is passing by
			I ask it "are you gloating ? " at my bloating friend and i ?

			"Dear sir" replied the cloud that was a floating up on high
			I see so many bloaters and so many as they try..
			to understand the nature of a floater floating by ?
			Is such a wonderous thing and now.. i bid you sir "goodbye" !

			A moonlit night we're floating and bloating you and i
			We pass the moon the stars all swoon.."good evening" as we cry..
			And as we float the endless sky..and never knowing why ?
			we're floating and a bloating ...floating you and i</p>

	<h2>A Year of Colour</h2>
		<p>In the winter garden
				of the Villa del Parma
				by the artist’s studio
				green grass turns vert de terre
				and the stone walls
				a wet mouse’s back
				grounding neutral – but calm,
				soothing like calamine
				in today’s mizzle,
				a permanent dimpsey,
				fine drenching drizzle,
				almost invisible, yet
				saturating skylights
				with evidence of rain.
