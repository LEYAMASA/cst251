					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p>The challenges of this lab was going through the process of
						setting up a CSS file to stylize the HTML. Eva-lyn and I went
						through the process of editing and experimenting with CSS settings
					  of making our div sections put near together.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>The problems I had for this lab was not understanding how div
							tags were used. I had no idea in the first place of what they were
							used for as that would prove to be a struggle in editing the CSS
							without some peer guidance from  my partner. Eva-lyn helped me
							with setting up the div tags in the HTML just to show me how they
						 are meant to be used. As for CSS, Eva-lyn and I struggled getting
					  	to know how to edit CSS border lines for our lab web page. We
							still don't understand of how the border goes over the divider
							boxes as we would like to ask how it can be manipulated.</p>
