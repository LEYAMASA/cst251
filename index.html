	<h1>Leo Yamasaki</h1>
	<main>
		<p>My name is <b>Leo Yamasaki</b> and my partner's name is Eva-Lyn Mendoza.
		I am a CSUMB student studying Communications Design major with a concentration
		on Visual Design to become a graphic designer. You might at first glance
		see that I am a reserved and quirky individual, but you'll find that I am
		a passionate and imaginative individual who loves listening to deep and
		insightful conversations about contrast.</p>

		<p>I'm also a video game modder for a project called "Awakening of the
			Rebellion" where I organize documentation, co-design gameplay ideas,
		as well as creating informational databases</p>

		<p>I'm excited to learn on how to design my own website as a skill
		which I will learn from CST-251 class in Spring 2021 semester</p>
