	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>My name is Leo Yamasaki and my partner's name is Eva-Lyn Mendoza.
	I am a CSUMB student studying Communications Design major with a concentration
	on Visual Design to become a graphic designer. You might at first glance
	see that I am a reserved and quirky individual, but you'll find that I am
	a passionate and imaginative individual who loves listening to deep and
	insightful conversations about contrast. I am very much looking forward to
	learning what Web Design class has to offer to develop my designing skills.
</p>
<p>Eva-lyn is a CD student with a concentration in Game design. She wants to
	have a career in character design and development for video game projects
	in the future. She likes to draw and collect old post cards.
	She is very excited to cooperate with and learn new skills with me.
